The given problem is based upon solving queries of persons of different classes i.e. Faculty and Students. Thus, these queries can be 
compared to different processes in terms of operating system where each process has its demands and needs resources and time for its 
execution. And this demands of processes are handled by the CPU. In the given scenario, Mr. Sudesh Sharma, Linux expert, can be considered 
as a CPU, who solves the queries of either Faculty or Student by allocating proper resources to their individual demands and processing them
by allocating them time accordingly. Now, Mr. Sharma, wants to provide priority for each query based upon its class, as well as, he wants
to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request. Thus in Operating System, if we divide the requests into two separate queues i.e. 
Faculty and Student such that the first queue contains faculty queries has higher priority and the second contains student queries which 
has lower priority, then we can resolve the problem, by allocating them required resources based upon their priorities as done in the 
scheduling algorithm in operating systems.
